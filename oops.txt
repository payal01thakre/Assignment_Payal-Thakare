Object oriented programming (oops)

1) Object - it is real world entity which have state and behavior.

2)class - collection of objects,blueprint from which we create individual object.
          class doesnt consume any space.

3)Inheritance - When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a 
                parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. 
                It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

4)Polymorphism - If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism. 
                 For example: to convince the customer differently,
                to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc. 

5)Abstraction - Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. 
               For example phone call, we don't know the internal processing.        
                in Java we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

6)Encapsulation - Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.
                   For example, a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.

                 A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully
                 encapsulated class because all the data members are private here.
